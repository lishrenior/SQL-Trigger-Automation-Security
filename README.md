# SQL-Trigger-Automation-Security
Developing automated security constraints and business logic triggers in PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and track system anomalies.

Highlights of the Project:


Automated Forensics: Developed PostgreSQL triggers to automatically detect "Missing Returns," creating a digital audit trail for asset circulation. 


System Hardening: Engineered complex SQL constraints and User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to prevent malformed data injection and ensure 100% data traceability. 


Performance Analytics: Leveraged EXPLAIN ANALYZE to interpret query execution plans and optimized data retrieval speeds through function-based indexing. 


Defensive Logic: Implemented checksum algorithms (Mod 10) for barcode generation to ensure hardware-level data validity.
